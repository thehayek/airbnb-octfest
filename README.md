## Project Motivation

To complete a project within the Data Scientist Nanodegree Program by Udacity asking for writing a data science blog post I used data from the [Inside Airbnb site](http://insideairbnb.com) to have a look at offers of hosts of Airbnb in Munich, Germany to find price changes for the Octoberfest. The data used was compiled on March 15, 2019.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code is in just one jupyter notebook that can be easily run with the Anaconda distribution with Python 3:

`jupyter notebook airbnb.ipynb`

## Results <a name="results"></a>

The main results of the project can be found in the post available [here](https://medium.com/).

## License <a name="license"></a>

The data behind the [Inside Airbnb site](http://insideairbnb.com) is available under a Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) "Public Domain Dedication" license. The same license shall apply for the rest of the project.
